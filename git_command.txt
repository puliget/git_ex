issuse current branch on local directory is not pushing into remote directory existing branch 
Git can't make your change to a remote repository without losing commits. When this happens, your push is refused.

reason:If another person has pushed to the same branch as you, Git won't be able to push your changes:
    ans:You can fix this by fetching and merging the changes made on the remote branch with the changes that you have made locally or force push 
git diff --staged

git show --name-only <ref_no/-branch_name> (it will display only file name)
git show <ref_no/branch_name>:file_name[optional](showing content of files and file)
git restore -s <branch_name/frist character commit_name>: -- file_name(it will restore that file)
git restore -s <branch_name/commit_name> <path to store>(to restore all file)
git remote -v (it show the remote name, path link to remote_name and puropse it )
git reflog <branch_name[optional]> (it will store history in a local directory using git untill 90 days,after it history is remove automatic)
